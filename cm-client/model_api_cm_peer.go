// Information about a Cloudera Manager peer instance. <p> The requirement and usage of <i>username</i> and <i>password</i> properties are dependent on the <i>clouderaManagerCreatedUser</i> flag. <p> When creating peers, if 'clouderaManagerCreatedUser' is true, the username/password should be the credentials of a user with administrator privileges on the remote Cloudera Manager. These credentials are not stored, they are used to connect to the peer and create a user in that peer. The newly created user is stored and used for communication with that peer. If 'clouderaManagerCreatedUser' is false, which is not applicable to REPLICATION peer type, the username/password to the remote Cloudera Manager are directly stored and used for all communications with that peer. <p> When updating peers, if 'clouderaManagerCreatedUser' is true and username/password are set, a new remote user will be created. If 'clouderaManagerCreatedUser' is false and username/password are set, the stored username/password will be updated.

	// When creating peers, if 'clouderaManagerCreatedUser' is true, this should be the remote admin username for creating a user in remote Cloudera Manager. The created remote user will then be stored in the local Cloudera Manager DB and used in later communication. If 'clouderaManagerCreatedUser' is false, which is not applicable to REPLICATION peer type, Cloudera Manager will store this username in the local DB directly and use it together with 'password' for communication.  Mutable during update. When set during update, if 'clouderaManagerCreatedUser' is true, a new user in remote Cloudera Manager is created, the newly created remote user will be stored in the local DB. An attempt to delete the previously created remote user will be made; If 'clouderaManagerCreatedUser' is false, the username/password in the local DB will be updated.

	// If true, Cloudera Manager creates a remote user using the given username/password and stores the created user in local DB for use in later communication. Cloudera Manager will also try to delete the created remote user when deleting such peers.  If false, Cloudera Manager will store the provided username/password in the local DB and use them in later communication. 'false' value on this field is not applicable to REPLICATION peer type.  Available since API v11.  Immutable during update. Should not be set when updating peers.
